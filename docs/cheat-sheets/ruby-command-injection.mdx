# Command injection prevention for Ruby

#### Check your project for these conditions:

```bash
semgrep --config p/ruby-command-injection
```

## 1. Running an OS command

### 1.A. Executing commands with `exec()`

The `exec()` function replaces the current process by running the given external command, allowing user input in a command that is passed as an argument to `exec()` can create an opportunity for a command injection vulnerability.

Example:

```ruby
exec(...)
...
```

#### References

- [`exec()` documentation](https://apidock.com/ruby/Kernel/exec)

#### Mitigation

Ensure evaluated content is not definable by external sources. TODO(1):

#### Semgrep rule

<LinkToRegistryRule ruleId="ruby.lang.security.dangerous-exec.dangerous-exec" />

### 1.B. Using syscall() to run OS functions

The `syscall()` calls the operating system function identified by num and returns the result of the function or raises SystemCallError if it failed.

Example:

```ruby
syscall(...)
...
```

#### References

- [`syscall()` documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Kernel:syscall)

#### Mitigation

As mentioned in the documentation - `syscall` is essentially unsafe and unportable.

#### Semgrep rule

<LinkToRegistryRule ruleId="ruby.lang.security.dangerous-syscall.dangerous-syscall" />

### 1.C. Running code with Open3 module

`Open3` grants you access to stdin, stdout, stderr and a thread to wait the child process when running another program. Such methods as `capture2`, `capture2e`, `capture3`, `popen2`, `popen2e`, `popen3`, `pipeline`, `pipeline_r`, `pipeline_rw`, `pipeline_start` and `pipeline_w` are intended for runnig commands provided as a string. Letting user supplied data in a command that is passed as an argument to one of these methods, can create an opportunity for a Command Injection vulnerability.

Example:

```java
Open3.pipeline(...)
...
```

#### References

- [`Open3` documentation](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Open3.html)

#### Mitigation

Do not let user input in `Open3` methods.

#### Semgrep rule

<LinkToRegistryRule ruleId="ruby.lang.security.dangerous-open3-pipeline.dangerous-open3-pipeline" />

### 1.D. Using `open()` tu run subprocesses

Creates an `IO` object connected to the given stream, file, or subprocess.description here. If first argument starts with a pipe character (`|`), a subprocess is created. Allowing user input in a command that is passed as an argument to `open()`, can create an opportunity for a Command Injection vulnerability.

Example:

```ruby
open(...)
...
```

#### References

- [`open()` documentation](https://apidock.com/ruby/Kernel/open)

#### Mitigation

Ensure command is not definable by external sources. TODO(1)

#### Semgrep rule

<LinkToRegistryRule ruleId="ruby.lang.security.dangerous-open.dangerous-open" />
